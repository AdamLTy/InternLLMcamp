        'Accurate segmentation of topological tubular structures, such as blood vessels and roads, is crucial for ensuring precision and efficiency in downstream tasks across multiple fields, including medical imaging, autonomous driving, and urban planning.', 
        'The segmentation of tubular structures is complicated by factors such as thin local structures, variable global morphologies, and the intricate nature of these shapes, which can make it difficult to capture essential features accurately.', 
        'DSCNet enhances perception through a three-stage approach: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss constraint. It employs a dynamic snake convolution for capturing features, a multi-view feature fusion strategy for integrating perspectives, and a continuity constraint loss function to maintain topological continuity in segmentation.',
        'The dynamic snake convolution is designed to accurately capture the features of tubular structures by adaptively focusing on slender and tortuous local structures, allowing for better representation of these intricate shapes during segmentation.',
        'The multi-view feature fusion strategy complements attention to features from multiple perspectives during the fusion process, ensuring that important information from different global morphologies is retained and integrated effectively.',
        'The continuity constraint loss function, based on persistent homology, helps constrain the topological continuity of the segmentation, ensuring that the segmented structures maintain their inherent shape and connectivity.',
        'The performance of DSCNet was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately segmenting tubular structures in various dimensions.',
        'Experiments indicate that DSCNet provides better accuracy and continuity for tubular structure segmentation compared to several other existing methods, showcasing its advantages in this domain.',
        'the codes for DSCNet are publicly available, allowing other researchers and practitioners to access and utilize the method in their own work.',
        'Persistent homology is significant because it provides a mathematical framework for analyzing topological features in data, which helps ensure that the segmentation results reflect the true topological continuity of the tubular structures being analyzed.',
        'The main focus of the research is to develop a method for accurately segmenting tubular structures, such as blood vessels and roads, using Dynamic Snake Convolution that incorporates topological geometric constraints. This approach aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation tasks in various applications.',
        'The authors of the research are Yaolei Qi, Yuting He, Xiaoming Qi, Yuan Zhang, and Guanyu Yang.',
        'The Key Laboratory is located at Southeast University in Nanjing, China.',
        'Guanyu Yang has multiple affiliations:Key Laboratory of New Generation Artificial Intelligence Technology and Its Interdisciplinary Applications at Southeast University, Nanjing, China.Jiangsu Province Joint International Research Laboratory of Medical Information Processing at Southeast University, Nanjing, China.Centre de Recherche en Information Biomedicale Sino-Fran√ßais (CRIBs) in Strasbourg, France.',
        'The proposed segmentation method for tubular structures could benefit various fields, including medical imaging (for accurate segmentation of blood vessels), urban planning (for analyzing road networks), and other applications that require precise detection of tubular geometries in images or datasets.',
        'Topological geometric constraints refer to rules or guidelines that govern the shape and connectivity of tubular structures. They are important in segmentation because they help ensure that the detected structures maintain their intended shapes and relationships, thus enhancing the accuracy and continuity of the segmentation results.',
        'Dynamic Snake Convolution likely adapts its parameters based on the specific geometric and topological characteristics of tubular structures, allowing it to focus more effectively on slender and tortuous shapes. This adaptability distinguishes it from traditional convolution methods, which typically apply static filters without considering the unique properties of the structures being analyzed.',
